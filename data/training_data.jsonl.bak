{"text": "National Guard member dies as ambush in US capital becomes political flashpoint. By Jeff Mason and Jasper Ward\n\nPALM BEACH, Florida/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A National Guard member died on Thursday after being shot near the White House in an ambush that investigators say was carried out by an Afghan national, an attack President Donald Trump blamed on Biden-era immigration vetting failures as he ordered a sweeping review of asylum cases.\n\nSarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds and her fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was \"fighting for his life,\" Trump said, as investigators conducted what officials said was a terrorism probe after Wednesday's shooting.\n\nThe FBI searched multiple properties in a widening investigation, including a home in Washington state linked to the suspect, who officials said was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the U.S. in 2021 under a resettlement program.\n\nAgents seized numerous electronic devices from the residence of the suspect, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, including cellphones, laptops, and iPads, and interviewed his relatives, FBI Director Kash Patel told a news conference.\n\nU.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C. Jeanine Pirro said the suspect drove cross-country and then ambushed the Guard members while they were patrolling near the White House on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"I want to express the anguish and the horror of our entire nation that the terrorist attack yesterday in our nation's capital, in which a savage monster gunned down two service members in the West Virginia National Guard, who were deployed as part of the DC Task Force,\" Trump said in a Thanksgiving call with U.S. military service members.\n\nCasting blame on the administration of his White House predecessor, President Joe Biden, Trump said the alleged gunman, who he described as having gone \"cuckoo,\" was among thousands of Afghans who came in unvetted as the U.S. carried out a chaotic withdrawal in 2021. He provided no evidence to support his assertion.\n\nTrump said the suspect's \"atrocity reminds us that we have no greater national security priority than ensuring that we have full control over the people that enter and remain in our country.\"\n\nArmed with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, the gunman shot the two National Guard members before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops. He was in hospital in serious condition, Trump said.\n\n\"My baby girl has passed to glory,” Gary Beckstrom, father of the National Guard member who died, wrote on social media, adding that his family was grappling with a \"horrible tragedy.\" Trump later spoke by phone to Beckstrom's parents, a White House official said.\n\nSUSPECTED ASSAILANT ACTED ALONE\n\nThe alleged assailant, who lived in Washington state with his wife and five children, appeared to have acted alone, said Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nAsked whether he was planning to deport the suspect's wife and five children who live in Washington state, Trump said, \"We're looking at the whole situation with family.\"\n\nThe program under which the suspect entered the U.S., which allowed in more than 70,000 Afghan nationals, according to a congressional report, was designed with vetting procedures, including by U.S. counter-terrorism and intelligence agencies. But the large scale and rushed nature of the evacuations led critics to say the background checks were inefficient.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News the U.S. government planned to bring terrorism charges against the gunman and seek a sentence of life in prison \"at a minimum.\" Following the death of the National Guard member, she suggested she would seek the death penalty.\n\nAt the press conference, Patel described the shootings as a \"heinous act of terrorism,\" but neither he nor Pirro offered a possible motive.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Trump echoed Pirro and Patel's accusations that the Biden administration was to blame for policies they said allowed the Afghan immigrant into the U.S., but they also offered no evidence to support their assertions\n\nThe alleged gunman was granted asylum this year under Trump, according to a U.S. government file on him seen by Reuters.\n\nTrump did not dispute that, but told reporters, \"When it comes to asylum, when they're flown in, it's very hard to get them out. No matter how you want to do it, it's very hard to get them out, but we're going to be getting them all out now.\"\n\nThe incident may give Trump, who has made cracking down on both legal and illegal immigration a centerpiece of his presidency, an opening to argue that even legal pathways like asylum pose security risks for Americans.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the shooting, Trump officials began ordering widespread reviews of immigration policies.\n\nThe Trump administration was launching a review of all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration as well as Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries, Department of Homeland Security officials said.\n\nMEMBER OF CIA-BACKED FORCE\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement that Lakanwal had worked with CIA-backed local units in Afghanistan, but gave no further details.\n\nThe New York Times, citing unnamed officials, identified the CIA-backed force as a Zero Unit, trained and supported by the U.S. spy agency in the southern province of Kandahar.\n\nThe units comprised a paramilitary group trained to conduct night raids and clandestine missions during the U.S. war in Afghanistan and, with thousands of members, had officially become part of the Afghan intelligence service by the time the U.S. withdrew its troops, the Times said.\n\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security, Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program to resettle thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the Afghanistan war and feared reprisals from Taliban forces who seized control after the U.S. withdrawal there.\n\n“The Biden Administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the U.S. Government,” Ratcliffe said in a statement. “This individual - and so many others - should have never been allowed to come here.”\n\nA Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024 and was approved on April 23 this year, three months after Trump took office. Lakanwal, who resided in Washington state, had no known criminal history, the official said.\n\nThe two Guard members from West Virginia were part of a militarized law enforcement mission ordered by Trump in August and challenged in court by Washington, D.C., officials.\n\n(Reporting by Ted Hesson, Jeff Mason, Lucia Mutikani, Jasper Ward, Tim Reid and Jana Winter; Writing by Julia Harte, Rod Nickel and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Ross Colvin, Deepa Babington and Diane Craft)", "title": "National Guard member dies as ambush in US capital becomes political flashpoint", "sentiment": "negative", "reasoning": "The article reports a violent and tragic event, a terrorist attack, resulting in the death of a National Guard member and injuring another, which overall contributes to a negative sentiment.", "source": "https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/national-guard-member-dies-ambush-us-capital-becomes-political-flashpoint", "published": "2025-11-27T22:36:38-0500", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:59:44.766805"}
{"text": "Analysis: Ukraine’s Zelensky faces hideous choice between bad deal and no deal. US President Donald Trump has stepped back from his Thanksgiving deadline for a deal in Ukraine, despite his urge to be seen as the peacemaker.\n\nIt is a key signal the coming denouement of his peace initiative – now a meeting in Moscow between his envoy Steve Witkoff and the Kremlin – will likely not yield a sudden deal to end Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe gaps between Kyiv and Moscow remain too explicit, and their reasons for obstinacy too drenched in sacrifice, anxiety and blood. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reluctance to accept any proposal that does not leave him in control of all of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region will likely remain clear over the coming days.\n\nThe latest US proposal headed his way apparently strips that key concession from the plan leaked last week, something neither Kyiv nor its European allies consider militarily or politically wise. Given the decade-long history of this war – Russia’s three invasions of Ukrainian territory, over years of diplomacy and deceit – there is justification to doubt Moscow’s sincerity.\n\nThis repetitive, cyclic failure to grasp the gulf between the two warring sides – hammered out in two separate negotiating tracks – is ultimately why progress always seems so close, yet also so unattainable. Negotiating one deal with Ukraine and then another with Russia, then hoping the two get close enough to hold, provides the tantalizing illusion of progress, but in practice leads nowhere. The sticking points stick.\n\nMuch of the proposed deal involves putative, theoretical ideas about future alliances, financing or limits. But like parts of memorandums past, these elements may morph into something more practical, or disappear entirely, in the months after any deal is signed.\n\nUkraine won’t need an army of 600,000, the limit proposed in the draft deal, if it truly sees peace. NATO membership will likely become less urgently needed, and less viable in peacetime, when Ukraine must demobilize and handle the economic nightmare of a post-war economy, with the damage that will do to its armed forces’ integrity.\n\nWill Russia rejoin the G8? It may want to, but the idea of Putin shaking hands at a summit with the leaders of the European states that still despise him seems farfetched. Who will pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction? Any grasp of how opaque business can be in Russia and Ukraine will tell you that won’t be simple or transparent, whatever the scheme. These points in any deal are important to address, but may alter in first contact with reality.\n\nThe single most vital issue is whether any deal actually stops the war. And Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is likely headed towards again having to grapple with a hideous trade-off. He must weigh the value of future security guarantees, formalized by the United States and Europe, against the real and inevitable damage that conceding Donetsk would do to his, and Ukraine’s, political and military standing. It is a bad choice if a deal sticks. There is no choice if, in the long term, as before, the Kremlin does not honor the deal.\n\nA serviceman for Ukrainian Armed Forces checks the sky for Russian combat drones, near the frontline town of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region, Ukraine, on Thursday. Reuters\n\nBut the immediate future does not bring better news. A myriad of crises envelope Zelensky’s government. President Donald Trump’s deadline has displaced from the headlines a corruption scandal that re-emerged Friday with the news that corruption investigators searched the home of his chief-of-staff and lead negotiator, Andriy Yermak.\n\nUkraine’s military has a manpower crisis. Funding from Kyiv’s European allies is in doubt next year, although the European Union recently said it thinks it can bridge the gap. And on the front lines, three separate crises are unfolding: Russia is moving fast in Zaporizhzhia, slowly but inevitably in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, and forwards in Kupiansk, further to the north. Ukraine cannot fight this many fires with so few soldiers.\n\nThe remainder of Donetsk under Kyiv’s control is also imperiled this winter. The major military hub of Kramatorsk is already subject to Russian short-range drone attacks, as Moscow’s forces are close enough. Kyiv won’t be taking territory back from Russia any time soon. The calculus ahead for Kyiv and its allies is not when can they turn around the progress of the war, but rather, can they get the Russians to break first?\n\nA serviceman Ukrainian Armed Forces checks the sky as he looks out for Russian combat drones, near the frontline town of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region, Ukraine, on Thursday. Reuters\n\nThe tacit hope of Kyiv and its allies, perhaps a forlorn one, is that Ukraine can push Russia’s brutal waste of manpower, and its total economic focus on the war, to the limit, and see it crack. It is impossible to predict in societies as closed as Russia how far away collapse might be. The Wagner rebellion of 2023 seemed fantastical, until Yevgeny Prigozhin’s men were on the road to Moscow over a turbulent 72 hours. Ukraine’s troubles are more open, and they are acute.\n\nThe fight ahead for Zelensky is fraught with risk. Russia is better resourced and making serious advances on the ground. Ukraine’s fight is existential – it doesn’t have Moscow’s luxury of one day deciding it has had enough and stopping the onslaught. But the net impact of the last 10 months of lumbering, diplomatic confusion and whiplash have made an unthinkable deal closer to becoming possible.\n\nA man walks next to a damaged building in Kramatorsk, in Ukraine’s industrial belt of Donetsk, on Wednesday. Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters\n\nThe idea of Ukraine ceding land to Moscow in exchange for peace was openly derided by Kyiv and Europe earlier this year, and throughout the Biden administration. Now it has found its way into the first iteration of the Trump 28-point peace plan. It has vanished from the leaked European counterproposal, but evidently not from Putin’s maximalist wish list.\n\nA cycle will surely now repeat itself. Trump’s special envoy Witkoff will likely hear once again during his visit to Moscow that Putin will not budge on his demand that Ukraine give up Donetsk in return for peace. Witkoff will communicate that to Trump. Zelensky will be pressured again, and another Thanksgiving-style deadline may ensue.", "title": "Analysis: Ukraine’s Zelensky faces hideous choice between bad deal and no deal", "sentiment": "negative", "reasoning": "The article discusses the challenges and obstacles in reaching a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, with a focus on the significant gaps and sticking points between the two sides, indicating a pessimistic outlook on the situation.", "source": "https://egyptindependent.com/analysis-ukraines-zelensky-faces-hideous-choice-between-bad-deal-and-no-deal/", "published": "Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:37:02 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:58:03.447328"}
{"text": "Inside Uzbekistan’s new multi-million-dollar cultural center. Four times taller than the Hollywood sign and around seven times larger than the White House, Uzbekistan’s newest cultural center is a monument of epic proportions.\n\nPart museum, part academic research facility, the three-story, $150-million Center for Islamic Civilization (CISC) in Tashkent will be open to the public in March 2026, and is intended to celebrate and revive Uzbekistan’s historical role as a center of Islamic scholarship.\n\n“This region has been home to many ancestors who influenced world civilization,” said Firdavs Abdukhalikov, director of CISC. “The big question was how to present their influence to the world, to younger generations, in an engaging and modern way.”\n\nOver the past eight years, while the building was under construction, CISC engaged 1,500 specialists from more than 40 countries to help develop the center’s scientific, architectural and cultural elements.\n\nFor example, through an “interactive educational zone” that leverages virtual reality, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence technologies for exhibits such as conversations with “living portraits” of historical scholars and thinkers, the center hopes to inspire children to explore astronomy, medicine, literature and art.\n\nThe second floor will be dedicated to research, where international academics can access more than 200,000 books in its library.\n\n“It’s not just a museum — it’s a cultural and educational platform. Here, we don’t only engage with artifacts, but also with the lives and ideas of influential figures,” Abdukhalikov added.\n\nReviving the past\n\nWhile Uzbekistan is a secular nation, Islam is a key part of its history and cultural identity.\n\nArab conquests brought Islam to Central Asia in the 7th century, replacing earlier Zoroastrian and Buddhist traditions, and between the 9th and 12th centuries, the region experienced a golden age of science, literature, and architecture.\n\nDiscover Samarkand, Uzbekistan 11 photos Registan Square: With its varied sights, including stunning mosques, mausoleums and madrassas, Samarkand is a must-visit Uzbekistan city. Among its major highlights is the stunning Registan Square. Tanatat Pongphibool/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMedieval Uzbekistan, and the wider Central Asian region, was “a globalized world before globalization,” said historian Farhan Ahmad Nizami, founding director of the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies at the University of Oxford, who’s not connected to the CISC.\n\nUzbek cities like Bukhara and Samarkand were important stops on the Silk Road, a cross-continental trade route that stretched from Venice to Xi’an for 1,500 years (130 BCE to 1453 CE), and became a confluence of culture and ideas from both the East and West.\n\n“(Uzbekistan’s) contribution in science and arts is obvious, and now people are rediscovering it, although it had not received sufficient attention,” Nizami added.\n\nLater, in the 15th and 16th centuries, the Timurid Empire would see a second renaissance of art, science, and diplomacy, with Samarkand at its center, an era that the CISC’s architecture draws inspiration from with its grand, mosaic-covered archways, blue tile-covered domes and intricate ornamentation.\n\nThe building, designed by Abdukakhkhor Turdiev, draws inspiration from classical Islamic architecture of Central Asia, particularly the Timurid era. CNN\n\nIn the 19th century, Russian expansion saw many parts of Central Asia incorporated into the Russian Empire, and later the Soviet Union, which imposed secular rule and suppressed Islamic practices.\n\n“A significant portion of our cultural treasures left the country during the Soviet times,” says Abdukhalikov.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1991 that Uzbekistan regained independence and began reviving its Islamic heritage and cultural identity. To this end, CISC was given a directive to recover its historic items.\n\n“We have participated in auctions such as Christie’s and Sotheby’s, bringing back parts of our cultural heritage. We have reclaimed 2,000 items and are continuing our work on this,” says Abdukhalikov.\n\nAn ancient manuscript displayed in the museum of the Center of Islamic Civilization Sylvain Dumond/CNN\n\nThe center’s exhibitions explore Uzbekistan’s history through these objects, including the 7th-century Quran of Uthman, one of the oldest in the world, and a collection of 114 Quranic manuscripts created by renowned rulers and calligraphers across the ages.\n\n‘Tremendous potential’\n\nWhile Nizami said the center has “tremendous potential,” he cautioned that “the building is a platform; what happens on the platform is entirely different,” stressing that its success depends on long-term research, education and cultural engagement.\n\nThere are criticisms of the center, relating to its cost, the sources of its funding, and the limited religious freedom in the country.\n\nCISC declined to comment on the building’s cost or funding sources.\n\nA construction fire in September delayed the center’s original launch, but the main construction work has been completed.\n\nWith around 60% of Uzbekistan’s population under the age of 35, Abdukhalikov said that the museum is for the next generation.\n\n“We have to inspire them and tell the story of our great history through innovation and creativity,” he added.", "title": "Inside Uzbekistan’s new multi-million-dollar cultural center", "sentiment": "positive", "reasoning": "The article discusses a new cultural center in Uzbekistan with a significant investment, showcasing the country's rich history and cultural identity, with no negative comments or criticisms mentioned.", "source": "https://egyptindependent.com/inside-uzbekistans-new-multi-million-dollar-cultural-center/", "published": "Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:36:58 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:58:08.200770"}

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi on Wednesday linked national progress directly to the strict enforcement of laws without exception, arguing that the entire society, including families, schools, and media, has a critical role in developing awareness to ensure the proper application of the legal framework.\n\nThe Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces made the remarks during an interactive dialogue with students applying to the Egyptian Military Academy and its affiliated Military Colleges at the Academy’s headquarters in the New Administrative Capital. Upon his arrival, he was received by Lieutenant General Ashraf Zaher, Director of the Egyptian Military Academy, and the directors of the military colleges.\n\nLaw Enforcement and National Governance\n\nThe President stated that while Egypt has many laws, the crucial element is the proper application of existing legislation, stressing that the issue has a societal dimension and requires the development of thought and awareness among citizens.\n\nResponding to a query about his position regarding certain observations during the Parliamentary elections voting process, Al-Sisi affirmed that his actions amounted to a “veto” in objection to certain practices he was not satisfied with. He stressed his desire for all matters to be completed optimally, noting that he is striving to change the situation for the better since 2014 but that this requires conviction and will from everyone. He affirmed that he would prevent any obstacles to achieving this goal.\n\nHe stressed the importance of local councils, governorates, and all officials maintaining their assigned roles to maintain order and immediately deal with street-level problems.\n\nMilitary Academy and Education Standards\n\nPresidential Spokesperson Mohamed El-Shenawy stated that the President began the physique examinations by reiterating the Academy’s commitment to selecting the best candidates with objectivity and impartiality, using the latest accurate scientific standards applied transparently through an automated system for the October 2025 intake.\n\nAl-Sisi said the Academy plays a significant role in shaping the Egyptian character and preparing youth for the country’s rapid development.\n\nThe President stated that the Military College of Medicine offers an academic level comparable to the world’s best medical schools, affirming that its graduates will compete with those from the world’s top universities. He confirmed that qualified female and male students can join the college either with a military or civilian designation, and stressed that the internship phase is an integral part of the study.\n\nEconomy and Digital Strategy\n\nIn his dialogue, Al-Sisi addressed the economic situation, the size of cash reserves, managing domestic and foreign debt, creating jobs for youth, and implementing artificial intelligence, mechanisation, and digitalisation within state institutions.\n\nHe explained that the state has an ambitious plan for digitalisation and incorporating these fields into education to align with the labour markets.\n\nRegarding self-sufficiency, the President pointed out that by 2026, 4.5 million feddans will be added to Egypt’s current cultivated area of approximately 9 million feddans. He clarified that achieving self-sufficiency in all basic goods is practically impossible, given that 95% of Egypt is desert land, stressing the importance of rationalising consumption.\n\nAl-Sisi reviewed the benefits of operating the El Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant, including the production of 4.8 gigawatts of electricity and potential support for nuclear medicine. He also stressed improving public health and physical fitness among youth.\n\nReligious Scholars and Regional Issues\n\nDuring a meeting with Doctorate holders from the Ministry of Endowments (Awqaf) set to join a two-year academic course at the Military Academy, attended by Dr. Osama El-Azhary, Minister of Endowments, Al-Sisi stated that the intense study hours (10-12 hours daily) exceed those required for a doctorate, aiming for genuine enlightenment, preparing scholars, and combatting backwardness and extremism. He called on the imams to be guardians of freedom, including the freedom of belief.\n\nOn regional issues, Al-Sisi affirmed that Egypt seeks to achieve stability in all troubled countries in the region, citing its efforts to stop the war in the Gaza Strip. He added that Egypt has lost approximately $8 bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea in past years.\n\nThe President concluded by attributing the solidarity of Egyptians to divine grace and favour.", "title": "Egypt’s Al-Sisi links national progress to strict law enforcement, says society has role in reforming legal application", "sentiment": "positive", "reasoning": "The article highlights President Al-Sisi's emphasis on strict law enforcement and societal role in reform, indicating a sense of stability and progress, with a focus on national governance and education standards.", "source": "https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/26/egypts-al-sisi-links-national-progress-to-strict-law-enforcement-says-society-has-role-in-reforming-legal-application/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=egypts-al-sisi-links-national-progress-to-strict-law-enforcement-says-society-has-role-in-reforming-legal-application", "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:46:50 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:57:47.413563"}

The Israeli army and police said Thursday they were investigating the circumstances in which two Palestinians were shot dead in the occupied West Bank while seemingly surrendering to Israeli forces.\n\nThe incident in Jenin in the northern West Bank, a stronghold of Palestinian armed groups, was filmed from several angles, including by AFP.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority named the two men killed as 37-year-old Yussef Ali Asa'sa and 26-year-old Al-Muntasir Billah Mahmud Abdullah.\n\nIt said they were killed in a \"brutal\" summary execution and condemned the incident as a \"war crime\".\n\nIsrael's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir swiftly backed the forces who opened fire, saying: \"Terrorists must die!\"\n\n- Blood-soaked floor -\n\nVideos circulating on social media and on television channels showed two men emerging from a building with their arms raised, surrounded by Israeli forces.\n\nThey were then seen lying on the ground before being directed back inside the building.

The US will reexamine all green cards issued to people from 19 countries “of concern” at President Donald Trump’s direction, as the Trump administration intensifies its immigration crackdown following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC.\n\n“At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” Joe Edlow, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, wrote in a post on X Thursday.\n\nAsked for additional details, including which countries are considered to be “of concern,” USCIS pointed CNN to 19 countries listed in a June presidential proclamation.\n\nThe 19 countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n\nUSCIS said in a statement later Thursday that when vetting immigrants from those 19 countries, the agency will now take into consideration “negative, country specific factors,” which includes whether the country is able “to issue secure identity documents.”\n\nSince officials last night identified the suspect of the shooting as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, the Trump administration has ramped up its efforts to restrict immigration.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said Thursday the administration is also reviewing all asylum cases that were approved under former President Joe Biden.\n\n“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN, adding, “The Trump Administration is also reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden Administration.”\n\nLakanwal — who previously worked with the US government, including the CIA — came to the country in 2021 as part of Biden’s “Operation Allies Welcome” after assisting the US in Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in 2024, and the Trump administration granted it in April 2025, CNN previously reported.\n\nRahmanullah Lakanwal Department of Justice\n\nThe Alliance of Afghan Communities in the United States on Thursday condemned the shooting, while also expressing concerns over the impact of Lakanwal’s actions on the immigration process for other Afghan nationals.\n\n“A single individual’s crime must not jeopardize or obstruct the legal cases of thousands of deserving Afghans who meet all U.S. legal requirements,” the alliance said in a statement, which called for federal agencies to process Afghan immigrants as usual, without delays or suspensions.\n\nMore than 190,000 Afghans have resettled in the United States since the US military withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021, according to the State Department.\n\nIn a video address from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida late Wednesday, Trump blamed the Biden administration for bringing the alleged shooter to the US and argued the attack “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.”\n\nTrump said in the remarks, “We must now reexamine every single alien who’s entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.”\n\nTrump also lamented what he described as “20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners” who entered the US during his predecessor’s administration, casting it “a risk to our very survival.”\n\nThe administration’s latest move to reexamine green cards is in line with Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric. A green card is a document that deems its holder as a lawful permanent resident of the US. It differs from refugee and asylum programs — which the Trump administration has already sought to limit — though refugees must apply for a green card after one year of being in the US.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "title": "US will reexamine all green cards issued to people from 19 countries as Trump administration ramps up immigration crackdown", "sentiment": "negative", "reasoning": "The article discusses a crackdown on immigration, which may have a negative impact on individuals and economies, and the tone of the language used is restrictive and cautious.", "source": "https://egyptindependent.com/us-will-reexamine-all-green-cards-issued-to-people-from-19-countries-as-trump-administration-ramps-up-immigration-crackdown/", "published": "Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:38:49 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:57:54.696454"}

The death toll from Israel’s offensive in the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, has risen to 69,785, with 170,965 wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry said ten people were brought to Gaza hospitals in the past 24 hours, including two newly killed and eight whose bodies were recovered from beneath the rubble of destroyed buildings.\n\nIt added that since the ceasefire announced on 11 October, a total of 347 people have been killed and 889 injured, while 596 bodies have been retrieved from the debris during the same period. The ministry said it had received 15 additional bodies via the International Committee of the Red Cross, bringing the total number of bodies handed over to 345, of which 99 have been identified. Medical teams continue the process of documenting and preparing the remains for handover to families.\n\nThe ministry warned of an unprecedented collapse of Gaza’s health system, reporting that 54 percent of essential medicines are unavailable, while 40 percent of emergency drugs have completely run out. It said 82 percent of infants under one year are suffering from anaemia, and 18,100 patients are awaiting permission to travel for treatment. Medical supplies are at their lowest levels ever recorded in Gaza, with 71% of items unavailable due to Israeli restrictions.\n\nOn the issue of captives and bodies, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said the group’s handover of the body of an Israeli soldier is part of its “commitment to fully completing the exchange process,” urging mediators to pressure Israel to halt the war and abide by the agreements reached.\n\nAs winter approaches, the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said thousands of displaced families in Gaza are struggling to find safe shelter in increasingly cold conditions.

Egypt’s economy grew by 5.3% in the first quarter of the 2025/2026 fiscal year, GDP growth exceeded 5% for the first time in more than three years, the Ministry of Planning, Economic Development, and International Cooperation said.\n\nThe GDP growth rate, up from 3.5% in the same period a year earlier, marks the strongest quarterly performance in over two years. The ministry attributed the acceleration to structural reforms that are bolstering the real economy and steering the growth model toward tradable, high-productivity sectors including manufacturing, tourism, and telecommunications.\n\nPrivate investments grew by 25.9%, accounting for 66% of total executed investments—the highest level recorded compared with previous periods. Conversely, the share of public investment declined to 34%, reflecting a government strategy to rationalise spending and prioritise high-impact projects while empowering the private sector.\n\n“This acceleration reflects the tangible impact of ongoing economic and structural reforms,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nMinister of Planning, Economic Development, and International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat said the higher-than-expected growth reflects sustained momentum driven by non-oil manufacturing, tourism, and telecommunications.\n\n“Macroeconomic stability enables structural reforms, while reforms reinforce stability, laying the foundation for sustainable growth,” Al-Mashat said, noting that preliminary indicators point to a positive outlook for the full fiscal year with projections of at least 5% GDP growth.\n\nSector Performance\n\nNon-oil manufacturing activity expanded by 14.5% during the quarter, compared to 7.1% in the previous year.

The ministry cited improved infrastructure and marketing campaigns for the rise, noting that Egypt has topped the list of leading African tourist destinations for the third consecutive year.\n\nSuez Canal activity recorded positive growth of 8.6%, the first increase since the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year.

Petroleum activity declined by 6.6% and natural gas by 10.9%. However, the ministry noted the pace of contraction has slowed compared to the 8.9% decline in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, supported by recent discoveries.\n\nSince August, 75 new oil and gas discoveries were made and 383 new wells added to the production map, addingapproximately 1.1bn cubic feet of gas and 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day to production capacity.\n\nLooking ahead, the ministry stated that a more stable regional environment is expected to further enhance confidence.

Israel has mounted regular incursions in southern Syria since then, citing goals that include keeping militants away from the frontier.\n\nThe Israeli military said its troops came under fire from militants during an overnight operation to detain suspects belonging to a group it identified as the Jaama Islamiya.

He lived in Bellingham, acoastal city near Canada's border, with his wife and five children.\n\nPirro said he ambushed the two National Guardsmen on Wednesday as they patrolled near the White House. Armed with a powerful handgun, a .357 Magnum, he shot one Guardsman who fell, and then shot them again, before firing multiple times at the second Guardsman, Pirro added.\n\nLakanwal was wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other Guardsmen before he was arrested and taken to hospital, where he remains under heavy guard. The authorities have not given an update on his condition or a motive for the attack.\n\nPirro said Lakanwal faces three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and a charge of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.\n\nHe will also be charged with murder in the first degree if the Guardsmen, who are currently in critical condition, do not survive their injuries, she said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox Newsthe U.S. government plans to bring terrorism charges against Lakanwal and seek a sentence of life in prison \"at a minimum.\"\n\nLakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era immigration program to resettle thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during the war and feared reprisal from Taliban forces who seized control after the U.S. withdrawal.

WINPEX plans to export its entire output.\n\nThe agreement was signed by Walid Youssef, Managing Director of MDC, and Malan Tang, Chairman of WINPEX, in the presence of senior officials from the authority and both companies.\n\nGamal El-Din said the Suez Canal Economic Zone has evolved into a prime investment destination, supported by robust infrastructure, fully developed utilities, and seamless integration between the authority’s industrial zones and ports. He highlighted the availability of well-trained technical labour, competitive renewable energy resources, and the zone’s unique access to global markets through ports overlooking both the Mediterranean and Red Seas. These advantages, he noted, are reinforced by multiple international trade agreements that position SCZONE as a global gateway and a strategic node in international supply chains.\n\nHe stressed the authority’s ongoing efforts to localise industry and transfer technology—efforts that support the national economy and align with Egypt’s Vision 2030 and the country’s economic development agenda, which prioritises attracting foreign direct investment and boosting exports.\n\nGamal El-Din also highlighted the key role of industrial developers, describing them as strategic partners in diversifying the investment landscape across the zone. He added that the continued expansion of Chinese investments reflects the depth of the strategic partnership and strong bilateral relations between Egypt and China.", "title": "China’s WINPEX to establish $15m lighting equipment plant in Ain Sokhna", "sentiment": "positive", "reasoning": "The article reports on a new investment agreement and the establishment of a factory, creating jobs and promoting exports, which indicates a positive development for Egypt's economy.", "source": "https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/26/chinas-winpex-to-establish-15m-lighting-equipment-plant-in-ain-sokhna/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=chinas-winpex-to-establish-15m-lighting-equipment-plant-in-ain-sokhna", "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 18:52:27 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:57:50.645512"}
