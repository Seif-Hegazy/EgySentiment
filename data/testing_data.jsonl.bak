{"text": "Afghan vetting process under renewed scrutiny following National Guard shooting in DC. President Donald Trump is blaming the Biden administration for this week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, in part by insisting that the suspect, a 29-year-old Afghan, was among millions of foreigners Biden allowed into the US without proper vetting.\n\nDetails about the alleged shooter’s background, including his previous work for the CIA in Afghanistan, and conversations with sources familiar with the vetting process, paint a far more complicated picture.\n\nWhile investigators have yet to establish a clear motive for the shooting, the incident is likely to rekindle concerns over the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the haste with which thousands of evacuees were brought to the US.\n\nTrump officials have suggested a breakdown in vetting is likely tied to the attack, while the president is already using it as a reason to further his crack down on immigrants in the US, including reevaluating the green card status of foreign nationals from a variety of countries.\n\nIn a video address from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida late Wednesday, Trump argued the attack carried out by a lone gunman “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.”\n\n“We must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” Trump said.\n\nThe suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was among more than 190,000 Afghans admitted into the US following its withdrawal from Afghanistan, under programs designed to resettle those who helped the US during its 20-year war in the country.\n\nOver the course of more than a decade, sources told CNN, Lakanwal underwent numerous rounds of vetting — starting around 2011 by the CIA when he began working with the US military and intelligence agencies — and ending earlier this year when he was approved for permanent asylum in the US by the Trump administration.\n\nUS President Donald Trump shows a printed photo during a call with service members from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 27, 2025, during the Thanksgiving holiday. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn 2021, Lakanwal was part of a prioritized group evacuated from Kabul after the Afghan capital fell to the Taliban. Due to his work for the US, including serving in an elite Afghan counterterrorism unit, Lakahwal was considered to be at risk of retribution once the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.\n\nOnce evacuated, Lakanwal went through what sources told CNN were multiple layers of vetting by multiple US government agencies — first in a Middle Eastern country, according to one source familiar with the matter — and then regularly over the past few years while he was residing in the US.\n\nIn April, Lakanwal, who lived in Washington state, was granted permanent asylum by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn June, the Justice Department released the results of an audit into the FBI’s role in facilitating screening Afghans brought to the US after the 2021 withdrawal. The audit, conducted by the department’s Inspector General, found no systemic breakdowns in the multi-layered process, involving various federal agencies, that was established at the time to screen and vet Afghan evacuees.\n\nThe report does acknowledge, however, that “the normal processes required to determine whether individuals posed a threat to national security and public safety were overtaken by the need to immediately evacuate and protect the lives of Afghans, increasing the potential that bad actors could try to exploit the expedited evacuation.”\n\nConcerns about the thoroughness of vetting for people admitted into the US after the Afghanistan withdrawal have caused angst in US security agencies for years.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, intelligence obtained from allies prompted the FBI to raise concerns about the thoroughness of vetting for Afghan and Central Asian asylum seekers, current and former US officials said.\n\nRampant use of fraudulent identification documents and the use of fixers with ties to terrorist groups were a primary concern.\n\nThe FBI sent agents to investigate the backgrounds of dozens of people who had been admitted to the US, and the reinvestigations prompted some removals, the officials said.\n\nStill, others disagree the vetting process is to blame for the shooting.\n\n“We don’t think this is a vetting issue,” said Shawn VanDiver, president of AfghanEvac, a non-profit group involved in helping resettle thousands of Afghans after the US withdrawal in 2021.\n\nTalking to CNN’s Becky Anderson Friday, VanDiver ticked through the extensive amount of screening Afghans like Lackanwal went through — including leading up to him attaining asylum this year.\n\n“People that came on the planes in August of 2021, they were vetted before they left. They were vetted when they went to a third country to continue their processing. They were vetted by [Customs and Border Patrol] and USCIS before they arrived here. While they were here, and awaiting adjustments of status, they were continuously vetted,” VanDiver said.\n\n“This is one man who, as the president said, ‘went cuckoo’ and took a deranged action that is not broadly indicative of the Afghan community at all,” VanDiver added.\n\nA Trump administration official pushed back on the notion that there was any semblance of normal protocol in place during this time.\n\n“The government was in shambles and in the process of being taken over by the Taliban. Our understanding, and what we’ve seen documented, is that there was very little vetting going on,” the official said.\n\nMultiple layers of vetting\n\nA picture of Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who is the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members, is displayed at a press conference in Washington, DC, on November 27. Nathan Howard/Reuters\n\nThe first round of vetting that Lakanwal received around 2011 by the CIA focused on determining whether he could safely work with US intelligence and military personnel in Afghanistan, according to a senior US official.\n\nAt the time, the CIA would have done its own vetting of Lakanwal through a variety of databases, including the National Counterterrorism Center database, to see if he had any known ties to terrorist groups, the senior official said.\n\nLakanwal was vetted again a decade later by the NCTC during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, before he was allowed entry into the US.\n\n“In terms of vetting, nothing came up,” the senior US official told CNN, noting the review did not show any ties to terror organizations. “He was clean on all checks.”\n\nThe senior official noted that the US government had been doing continuous, annual vetting of individuals since the Afghans’ arrival in the US, especially in the wake of the failed terror plot disrupted before the election last year in Oklahoma which involved an Afghan evacuee.\n\nTrump’s NCTC Director Joe Kent confirmed in a tweet Friday that Lakanwal was previously vetted by the US intelligence community while he was still overseas, but noted that screening was focused on his ability to serve alongside American forces in Afghanistan — not whether he was fit to become a permanent US resident.\n\n“It is true that the terrorist who conducted the attack in D.C. was ‘vetted’ by the intelligence community, however he was only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan, he was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen,” Kent said in the post.\n\nKent also accused the Biden administration of using that same standard for allowing individuals entry into the US during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, “foregoing previous vetting standards applied to Special Immigrant Visas and any common sense vetting or concern for Americans.”\n\n“As a result, over 85k Afghans—including individuals with backgrounds similar to this shooter— were rapidly admitted into our country without the rigorous vetting that has protected us in the past,” he claimed.\n\nEvacuees from Afghanistan, including US citizens, arrive at Hamad International Airport in Qatar’s capital Doha on the first flight carrying foreigners out of the Afghan capital since the conclusion of the US withdrawal last month, September 9, 2021. Karim Jaafar/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA chaotic withdrawal\n\nIn 2021, the Biden administration was under immense pressure from veterans groups to evacuate Afghans who had worked with American soldiers, some taking it upon themselves to help get people out of the country. The sense of urgency during that chaotic withdrawal raised bipartisan concerns about the screening process for Afghans who were ultimately admitted into the US.\n\nThat was due in part to the sheer volume of Afghans who were coming to the US and the urgency of the evacuation itself, which came as the US-backed government in Kabul was collapsing.\n\nAll of those factors contributed to concerns about the ability to accurately verify the identify of those being let into the US and vet them accordingly.\n\nThat process is now under intense scrutiny as Trump calls for a reexamination of every person from Afghanistan who came to the US under President Joe Biden, and criticizes what he says were millions of “unknown and unvetted foreigners” admitted to the country under his predecessor.\n\nOn Thursday, the administration announced it will reexamine all green cards issued to people from 19 countries “of concern” at Trump’s direction.\n\n“At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” Joe Edlow, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, wrote in a post on X Thursday.\n\nAsked for additional details, including which countries are considered to be “of concern,” USCIS pointed CNN to 19 countries listed in a June presidential proclamation.\n\nThe 19 countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said Thursday the administration is also reviewing all asylum cases that were approved under former President Joe Biden.\n\n“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN, adding, “The Trump Administration is also reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden Administration.”", "title": "Afghan vetting process under renewed scrutiny following National Guard shooting in DC", "sentiment": "negative", "reasoning": "The article discusses a shooting incident and blames the Biden administration, with President Trump using it to further his anti-immigrant stance, creating a negative tone.", "source": "https://egyptindependent.com/afghan-vetting-process-under-renewed-scrutiny-following-national-guard-shooting-in-dc/", "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 08:54:13 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-29T11:15:28.468978"}
{"text": "National Guard member dies as ambush in US capital becomes political flashpoint. By Jeff Mason and Jasper Ward\n\nPALM BEACH, Florida/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A National Guard member died on Thursday after being shot near the White House in an ambush that investigators say was carried out by an Afghan national, an attack President Donald Trump blamed on Biden-era immigration vetting failures as he ordered a sweeping review of asylum cases.\n\nSarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds and her fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was \"fighting for his life,\" Trump said, as investigators conducted what officials said was a terrorism probe after Wednesday's shooting.\n\nThe FBI searched multiple properties in a widening investigation, including a home in Washington state linked to the suspect, who officials said was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the U.S. in 2021 under a resettlement program.\n\nAgents seized numerous electronic devices from the residence of the suspect, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, including cellphones, laptops, and iPads, and interviewed his relatives, FBI Director Kash Patel told a news conference.\n\nU.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C. Jeanine Pirro said the suspect drove cross-country and then ambushed the Guard members while they were patrolling near the White House on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"I want to express the anguish and the horror of our entire nation that the terrorist attack yesterday in our nation's capital, in which a savage monster gunned down two service members in the West Virginia National Guard, who were deployed as part of the DC Task Force,\" Trump said in a Thanksgiving call with U.S. military service members.\n\nCasting blame on the administration of his White House predecessor, President Joe Biden, Trump said the alleged gunman, who he described as having gone \"cuckoo,\" was among thousands of Afghans who came in unvetted as the U.S. carried out a chaotic withdrawal in 2021. He provided no evidence to support his assertion.\n\nTrump said the suspect's \"atrocity reminds us that we have no greater national security priority than ensuring that we have full control over the people that enter and remain in our country.\"\n\nArmed with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, the gunman shot the two National Guard members before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops. He was in hospital in serious condition, Trump said.\n\n\"My baby girl has passed to glory,” Gary Beckstrom, father of the National Guard member who died, wrote on social media, adding that his family was grappling with a \"horrible tragedy.\" Trump later spoke by phone to Beckstrom's parents, a White House official said.\n\nSUSPECTED ASSAILANT ACTED ALONE\n\nThe alleged assailant, who lived in Washington state with his wife and five children, appeared to have acted alone, said Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nAsked whether he was planning to deport the suspect's wife and five children who live in Washington state, Trump said, \"We're looking at the whole situation with family.\"\n\nThe program under which the suspect entered the U.S., which allowed in more than 70,000 Afghan nationals, according to a congressional report, was designed with vetting procedures, including by U.S. counter-terrorism and intelligence agencies. But the large scale and rushed nature of the evacuations led critics to say the background checks were inefficient.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News the U.S. government planned to bring terrorism charges against the gunman and seek a sentence of life in prison \"at a minimum.\" Following the death of the National Guard member, she suggested she would seek the death penalty.\n\nAt the press conference, Patel described the shootings as a \"heinous act of terrorism,\" but neither he nor Pirro offered a possible motive.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Trump echoed Pirro and Patel's accusations that the Biden administration was to blame for policies they said allowed the Afghan immigrant into the U.S., but they also offered no evidence to support their assertions\n\nThe alleged gunman was granted asylum this year under Trump, according to a U.S. government file on him seen by Reuters.\n\nTrump did not dispute that, but told reporters, \"When it comes to asylum, when they're flown in, it's very hard to get them out. No matter how you want to do it, it's very hard to get them out, but we're going to be getting them all out now.\"\n\nThe incident may give Trump, who has made cracking down on both legal and illegal immigration a centerpiece of his presidency, an opening to argue that even legal pathways like asylum pose security risks for Americans.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the shooting, Trump officials began ordering widespread reviews of immigration policies.\n\nThe Trump administration was launching a review of all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration as well as Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries, Department of Homeland Security officials said.\n\nMEMBER OF CIA-BACKED FORCE\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement that Lakanwal had worked with CIA-backed local units in Afghanistan, but gave no further details.\n\nThe New York Times, citing unnamed officials, identified the CIA-backed force as a Zero Unit, trained and supported by the U.S. spy agency in the southern province of Kandahar.\n\nThe units comprised a paramilitary group trained to conduct night raids and clandestine missions during the U.S. war in Afghanistan and, with thousands of members, had officially become part of the Afghan intelligence service by the time the U.S. withdrew its troops, the Times said.\n\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security, Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program to resettle thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the Afghanistan war and feared reprisals from Taliban forces who seized control after the U.S. withdrawal there.\n\n“The Biden Administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the U.S. Government,” Ratcliffe said in a statement. “This individual - and so many others - should have never been allowed to come here.”\n\nA Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024 and was approved on April 23 this year, three months after Trump took office. Lakanwal, who resided in Washington state, had no known criminal history, the official said.\n\nThe two Guard members from West Virginia were part of a militarized law enforcement mission ordered by Trump in August and challenged in court by Washington, D.C., officials.\n\n(Reporting by Ted Hesson, Jeff Mason, Lucia Mutikani, Jasper Ward, Tim Reid and Jana Winter; Writing by Julia Harte, Rod Nickel and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Ross Colvin, Deepa Babington and Diane Craft)", "title": "National Guard member dies as ambush in US capital becomes political flashpoint", "sentiment": "negative", "reasoning": "The article reports a violent and tragic event, a terrorist attack, resulting in the death of a National Guard member and injuring another, which overall contributes to a negative sentiment.", "source": "https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/national-guard-member-dies-ambush-us-capital-becomes-political-flashpoint", "published": "2025-11-27T22:36:38-0500", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:59:44.766805"}
{"text": "US military carried out second strike killing survivors on a suspected drug boat that had already been attacked, sources say. The US military carried out a follow–up strike on a suspected drug vessel operating in the Caribbean on September 2 after an initial attack did not kill everyone on board, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nThat September strike was the first in what became a regular series of attacks on alleged drug boats.\n\nWhile the first strike appeared to disable the boat and cause deaths, the military assessed there were survivors, according to the sources. The second attack killed the remaining crew on board, bringing the total death toll to 11, and sunk the ship.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth had ordered the military prior to the operation to ensure the strike killed everyone on board, but it’s not clear if he knew there were survivors prior to the second strike, one of the sources said.\n\nThe strike and deaths were announced by President Donald Trump on the day of the attacks, but the administration has never publicly acknowledged killing survivors.\n\nTrump said on Thursday that action on land to stop suspected drug trafficking networks in Venezuela could “start very soon,” amid ongoing questions about the legality of the US military’s campaign around Latin America. Officials have acknowledged not knowing the identities of everyone on board the boats before they are struck, CNN has reported.\n\n“I have been alarmed by the number of vessels that this administration has taken out without a single consultation of Congress,” Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean told CNN this week. “Just last week, I took a look in a SCIF [sensitive compartmented information facility], because I’m a member of foreign affairs, at some documents around the sinking of these vessels and the murder of the people on those boats. Nowhere in there was there evidence of what was going on.”\n\nPeople briefed on the “double-tap” strike, said they were concerned that it could violate the law of armed conflict, which prohibits the execution of an enemy combatant who is “hors de combat,” or taken out of the fight due to injury or surrender.\n\n“They’re breaking the law either way,” said Sarah Harrison, a former associate general counsel at the Pentagon who now serves as a senior analyst at the Crisis Group think tank. “They’re killing civilians in the first place, and then if you assume they’re combatants, it’s also unlawful — under the law of armed conflict, if somebody is ‘hors de combat’ and no longer able to fight, then they have to be treated humanely.”\n\nDetails of the strikes were first reported by The Intercept and the Washington Post.\n\nHegseth in a social media post Friday continued to defend the strikes on alleged drug boats, writing, “Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command.”\n\n“Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” Hegseth said.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth attends a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, after a meeting of NATO defence ministers at the alliance’s headquarters, in Brussels, Belgium, on October 15, 2025. Yves Herman/Reuters\n\nThe US military was aware that there were survivors in the water following the first strike on September 2 and carried out another to both sink the vessel and kill the remaining crew, the sources said. Pentagon officials told lawmakers in briefings afterward that the second strike was done to sink the boat so it would not pose a threat to navigation, the sources said.\n\nThe US military has hit boats multiple times in several instances to sink them, the sources said, but the September 2 strike is the only known instance where the military deliberately killed survivors.\n\nIt is not clear why the survivors were not picked up, as they were following another strike in the Caribbean in October. In that instance, the Trump administration rescued two survivors and repatriated them to their home countries.\n\nIn a post announcing the September 2 strike on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said that the US military had conducted “a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n\nThe administration has tried to legally justify its strikes on the boats by claiming they are carrying individuals linked to roughly two dozen drug cartels engaged in an armed conflict with the US. The White House has said repeatedly that the administration’s actions “comply fully with the Law of Armed Conflict,” the area of international law that is designed to prevent attacks on civilians.\n\nMany legal experts, however, say the suspected drug traffickers are civilians, not combatants, and that the strikes therefore amount to extrajudicial killings.\n\nBefore the US military began blowing up boats in September, countering illicit drug trafficking was handled by law enforcement and the US Coast Guard, and cartel members and drug smugglers were treated as criminals with due process rights.\n\nBut in a classified legal opinion produced over the summer, the Justice Department argued that the president is legally allowed to authorize lethal strikes against 24 cartels and criminal organizations in self-defense, because the groups pose an imminent threat to Americans, CNN has reported.\n\nThat argument has potentially been undercut by the behavior of the suspected traffickers who have been targeted: in at least one instance, a boat had turned around and was moving away from the US before being struck. Survivors of the strike on September 2 also posed no imminent threat, since they were effectively incapacitated, the sources briefed on the strikes and Harrison noted.\n\nSenior US defense officials and US allies have expressed skepticism of the legality of the military campaign. The commander of US Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey, offered to leave his post during a tense meeting last month with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after he raised questions about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Holsey will leave his post in December, just one year into his tenure as the SOUTHCOM chief.\n\nLawyers specializing in international law within DoD’s Office of General Counsel have also raised concerns about the legality of the strikes. Multiple current and former uniformed lawyers told CNN that the strikes do not appear lawful.\n\nThe United Kingdom is also no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal, CNN has reported.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "title": "US military carried out second strike killing survivors on a suspected drug boat that had already been attacked, sources say", "sentiment": "negative", "reasoning": "The article discusses a controversial US military strike that killed survivors on a suspected drug boat, raising concerns about the legality and morality of the action, with some officials and lawmakers expressing alarm and criticism.", "source": "https://egyptindependent.com/us-military-carried-out-second-strike-killing-survivors-on-a-suspected-drug-boat-that-had-already-been-attacked-sources-say/", "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 08:45:44 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-29T11:15:32.905509"}
{"text": "Analysis: Ukraine’s Zelensky faces hideous choice between bad deal and no deal. US President Donald Trump has stepped back from his Thanksgiving deadline for a deal in Ukraine, despite his urge to be seen as the peacemaker.\n\nIt is a key signal the coming denouement of his peace initiative – now a meeting in Moscow between his envoy Steve Witkoff and the Kremlin – will likely not yield a sudden deal to end Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe gaps between Kyiv and Moscow remain too explicit, and their reasons for obstinacy too drenched in sacrifice, anxiety and blood. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reluctance to accept any proposal that does not leave him in control of all of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region will likely remain clear over the coming days.\n\nThe latest US proposal headed his way apparently strips that key concession from the plan leaked last week, something neither Kyiv nor its European allies consider militarily or politically wise. Given the decade-long history of this war – Russia’s three invasions of Ukrainian territory, over years of diplomacy and deceit – there is justification to doubt Moscow’s sincerity.\n\nThis repetitive, cyclic failure to grasp the gulf between the two warring sides – hammered out in two separate negotiating tracks – is ultimately why progress always seems so close, yet also so unattainable. Negotiating one deal with Ukraine and then another with Russia, then hoping the two get close enough to hold, provides the tantalizing illusion of progress, but in practice leads nowhere. The sticking points stick.\n\nMuch of the proposed deal involves putative, theoretical ideas about future alliances, financing or limits. But like parts of memorandums past, these elements may morph into something more practical, or disappear entirely, in the months after any deal is signed.\n\nUkraine won’t need an army of 600,000, the limit proposed in the draft deal, if it truly sees peace. NATO membership will likely become less urgently needed, and less viable in peacetime, when Ukraine must demobilize and handle the economic nightmare of a post-war economy, with the damage that will do to its armed forces’ integrity.\n\nWill Russia rejoin the G8? It may want to, but the idea of Putin shaking hands at a summit with the leaders of the European states that still despise him seems farfetched. Who will pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction? Any grasp of how opaque business can be in Russia and Ukraine will tell you that won’t be simple or transparent, whatever the scheme. These points in any deal are important to address, but may alter in first contact with reality.\n\nThe single most vital issue is whether any deal actually stops the war. And Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is likely headed towards again having to grapple with a hideous trade-off. He must weigh the value of future security guarantees, formalized by the United States and Europe, against the real and inevitable damage that conceding Donetsk would do to his, and Ukraine’s, political and military standing. It is a bad choice if a deal sticks. There is no choice if, in the long term, as before, the Kremlin does not honor the deal.\n\nA serviceman for Ukrainian Armed Forces checks the sky for Russian combat drones, near the frontline town of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region, Ukraine, on Thursday. Reuters\n\nBut the immediate future does not bring better news. A myriad of crises envelope Zelensky’s government. President Donald Trump’s deadline has displaced from the headlines a corruption scandal that re-emerged Friday with the news that corruption investigators searched the home of his chief-of-staff and lead negotiator, Andriy Yermak.\n\nUkraine’s military has a manpower crisis. Funding from Kyiv’s European allies is in doubt next year, although the European Union recently said it thinks it can bridge the gap. And on the front lines, three separate crises are unfolding: Russia is moving fast in Zaporizhzhia, slowly but inevitably in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, and forwards in Kupiansk, further to the north. Ukraine cannot fight this many fires with so few soldiers.\n\nThe remainder of Donetsk under Kyiv’s control is also imperiled this winter. The major military hub of Kramatorsk is already subject to Russian short-range drone attacks, as Moscow’s forces are close enough. Kyiv won’t be taking territory back from Russia any time soon. The calculus ahead for Kyiv and its allies is not when can they turn around the progress of the war, but rather, can they get the Russians to break first?\n\nA serviceman Ukrainian Armed Forces checks the sky as he looks out for Russian combat drones, near the frontline town of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region, Ukraine, on Thursday. Reuters\n\nThe tacit hope of Kyiv and its allies, perhaps a forlorn one, is that Ukraine can push Russia’s brutal waste of manpower, and its total economic focus on the war, to the limit, and see it crack. It is impossible to predict in societies as closed as Russia how far away collapse might be. The Wagner rebellion of 2023 seemed fantastical, until Yevgeny Prigozhin’s men were on the road to Moscow over a turbulent 72 hours. Ukraine’s troubles are more open, and they are acute.\n\nThe fight ahead for Zelensky is fraught with risk. Russia is better resourced and making serious advances on the ground. Ukraine’s fight is existential – it doesn’t have Moscow’s luxury of one day deciding it has had enough and stopping the onslaught. But the net impact of the last 10 months of lumbering, diplomatic confusion and whiplash have made an unthinkable deal closer to becoming possible.\n\nA man walks next to a damaged building in Kramatorsk, in Ukraine’s industrial belt of Donetsk, on Wednesday. Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters\n\nThe idea of Ukraine ceding land to Moscow in exchange for peace was openly derided by Kyiv and Europe earlier this year, and throughout the Biden administration. Now it has found its way into the first iteration of the Trump 28-point peace plan. It has vanished from the leaked European counterproposal, but evidently not from Putin’s maximalist wish list.\n\nA cycle will surely now repeat itself. Trump’s special envoy Witkoff will likely hear once again during his visit to Moscow that Putin will not budge on his demand that Ukraine give up Donetsk in return for peace. Witkoff will communicate that to Trump.

{"text": "Zelensky dismissed his right-hand man. Is he weaker or stronger now?. Since before the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, he was rarely far from Volodymyr Zelensky’s side, whether welcoming foreign dignitaries to Kyiv, or accompanying the Ukrainian president abroad on crucial missions to secure military and diplomatic support.\n\nNow, Andriy Yermak’s resignation could become Zelensky’s biggest political test since taking office six-and-a-half years ago. While the departure will likely play well at home, it casts uncertainty into the heart of the administration at a critical diplomatic moment.\n\nYermak, the former head of the president’s office, quit on Friday after anti-corruption officers raided his home – apparently the latest and highest-profile casualty of Ukraine’s spiraling scandal over alleged kickbacks in the energy sector.\n\nThe upset comes as Ukraine faces mounting US pressure to sign a peace agreement widely seen as favoring Russia. Just days earlier, Yermak had been in Geneva, leading Ukraine’s team as they met with a US delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss the latest White House plan.\n\nAs he announced the dismissal, Zelensky said he was grateful to Yermak for “always representing Ukraine’s position in negotiations in exactly the right way.”\n\n“It has always been a patriotic position,” he added.\n\nAmong Ukrainians, Yermak’s downfall will likely find considerable approval.\n\nYermak had become a deeply unpopular figure who “somehow aggregated all the dissatisfaction with what the president does wrong,” Nataliya Gumenyuk, a member of the board of independent news media organization Hromadske, told CNN.\n\nA series of corruption scandals in recent years, a bust-up with his former, and highly popular, army chief, and the messy introduction of new mobilisation policies have all threatened to tarnish Zelensky’s image. But while his approval ratings are a way down from 2022 levels, they have held fairly steady over the last couple of years.\n\nAnother journalist, Olga Rudenko of the Kyiv Independent, said Yermak’s departure was proof of the strength of Ukrainian democracy.\n\n“Think about it: A young democracy like Ukraine has independent institutions that are strong enough to investigate the most powerful man in the country – and to do so during the war,” she wrote on X.\n\nA key question will be whether his departure increases the domestic pressure on Zelensky himself, or in fact turns the tide.\n\nGumenyuk said she believed Ukrainians would accept Zelensky’s framing of the loss of his right-hand man as a positive reset of his administration. And the president will have been heartened that MPs from his own party – some of whom had threatened to leave the party if Yermak remained in post – issued a statement praising him for putting the interests of the country first.\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky (right) and Head of the Office of the Presidency of Ukraine Andriy Yermak (left) during a meeting at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid on November 18. Oscar Del Pozo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut a former government official told CNN the decision had come too late, arguing many Ukrainians would now be asking what Zelensky knew about Yermak’s actions.\n\n“On the one side, you have his close ally, on the other side, you have his close friend, his former business partner,” the official said, referring to both Yermak and another man caught up in the latest scandal, Timur Mindich. “Do you really think the president wasn’t aware about this?”\n\nYermak’s widespread unpopularity was a function of his immense power as an electorally unaccountable head of the Presidential Office.\n\n“He was a shadow prime minister,” Orysia Lutsevych of London-based think tank Chatham House said, describing a man who effectively chose who would serve in Zelensky’s government.\n\nBut Yermak was also fiercely loyal to his boss.\n\n“There (was) a lot of co-dependency, they spent a lot of time together … Yermak positioned himself as a negotiator, as somebody who not only kind of runs the regular daily activities, but can solve problems,” Lutsevych said. “He’s a deal maker.”\n\nOf his chief adviser, Zelensky himself said last year: “I respect him for his results. He does what I tell him.”\n\nFor sure, it seems hard to believe that Ukraine’s leader will easily find a replacement in whom he can place as much trust and responsibility.\n\nAnd that’s before he weighs up the prosecution of the war and the international situation.\n\nYermak had been expected to go to the US this weekend to lead Ukraine’s delegation in another round of talks with the Trump administration.\n\nIt is unclear who will take his place as team leader, though Ukraine certainly has plenty of senior officials with experience of these highly difficult negotiations.\n\nAnd even though he played such a prominent role in Zelensky’s diplomatic endeavors, Yermak’s reputation abroad was not what it once was. Becoming embroiled in a major corruption scandal only further weakened his standing, particularly in the United States, where even the whiff of misappropriated funds has always proved a major stumbling block for many of Ukraine’s supporters in Congress.\n\nOne European diplomat based in Kyiv told CNN that Zelensky “had little choice but to fire Yermak in view of the damaging headlines carried by global media.”\n\nBut it is perhaps the optics of chaos at the heart of power in Kyiv that will prove most damaging.\n\nRussia, unsurprisingly, has seized on an opportunity to try to undermine Zelensky’s legitimacy.\n\n“(The) political uncertainty that is caused by this scandal is growing and growing very fast, day by day. One can hardly now make a prognosis on what is going to happen next,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN’s Matthew Chance.\n\nPulling all the threads together, Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister and a key international ally of Ukraine, saw things bleakly.\n\nHe drew attention to the fact Yermak’s dismissal took place on the same day as a visit by Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban to Moscow, and in the midst of what he called the “chaos in negotiations” with the United States.\n\n“A fatal combination,” he posted on X.", "title": "Zelensky dismissed his right-hand man.

{"text": "Inside Uzbekistan’s new multi-million-dollar cultural center. Four times taller than the Hollywood sign and around seven times larger than the White House, Uzbekistan’s newest cultural center is a monument of epic proportions.\n\nPart museum, part academic research facility, the three-story, $150-million Center for Islamic Civilization (CISC) in Tashkent will be open to the public in March 2026, and is intended to celebrate and revive Uzbekistan’s historical role as a center of Islamic scholarship.\n\n“This region has been home to many ancestors who influenced world civilization,” said Firdavs Abdukhalikov, director of CISC. “The big question was how to present their influence to the world, to younger generations, in an engaging and modern way.”\n\nOver the past eight years, while the building was under construction, CISC engaged 1,500 specialists from more than 40 countries to help develop the center’s scientific, architectural and cultural elements.\n\nFor example, through an “interactive educational zone” that leverages virtual reality, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence technologies for exhibits such as conversations with “living portraits” of historical scholars and thinkers, the center hopes to inspire children to explore astronomy, medicine, literature and art.\n\nThe second floor will be dedicated to research, where international academics can access more than 200,000 books in its library.\n\n“It’s not just a museum — it’s a cultural and educational platform. Here, we don’t only engage with artifacts, but also with the lives and ideas of influential figures,” Abdukhalikov added.\n\nReviving the past\n\nWhile Uzbekistan is a secular nation, Islam is a key part of its history and cultural identity.\n\nArab conquests brought Islam to Central Asia in the 7th century, replacing earlier Zoroastrian and Buddhist traditions, and between the 9th and 12th centuries, the region experienced a golden age of science, literature, and architecture.\n\nDiscover Samarkand, Uzbekistan 11 photos Registan Square: With its varied sights, including stunning mosques, mausoleums and madrassas, Samarkand is a must-visit Uzbekistan city. Among its major highlights is the stunning Registan Square. Tanatat Pongphibool/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMedieval Uzbekistan, and the wider Central Asian region, was “a globalized world before globalization,” said historian Farhan Ahmad Nizami, founding director of the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies at the University of Oxford, who’s not connected to the CISC.\n\nUzbek cities like Bukhara and Samarkand were important stops on the Silk Road, a cross-continental trade route that stretched from Venice to Xi’an for 1,500 years (130 BCE to 1453 CE), and became a confluence of culture and ideas from both the East and West.\n\n“(Uzbekistan’s) contribution in science and arts is obvious, and now people are rediscovering it, although it had not received sufficient attention,” Nizami added.\n\nLater, in the 15th and 16th centuries, the Timurid Empire would see a second renaissance of art, science, and diplomacy, with Samarkand at its center, an era that the CISC’s architecture draws inspiration from with its grand, mosaic-covered archways, blue tile-covered domes and intricate ornamentation.\n\nThe building, designed by Abdukakhkhor Turdiev, draws inspiration from classical Islamic architecture of Central Asia, particularly the Timurid era. CNN\n\nIn the 19th century, Russian expansion saw many parts of Central Asia incorporated into the Russian Empire, and later the Soviet Union, which imposed secular rule and suppressed Islamic practices.\n\n“A significant portion of our cultural treasures left the country during the Soviet times,” says Abdukhalikov.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1991 that Uzbekistan regained independence and began reviving its Islamic heritage and cultural identity. To this end, CISC was given a directive to recover its historic items.\n\n“We have participated in auctions such as Christie’s and Sotheby’s, bringing back parts of our cultural heritage. We have reclaimed 2,000 items and are continuing our work on this,” says Abdukhalikov.\n\nAn ancient manuscript displayed in the museum of the Center of Islamic Civilization Sylvain Dumond/CNN\n\nThe center’s exhibitions explore Uzbekistan’s history through these objects, including the 7th-century Quran of Uthman, one of the oldest in the world, and a collection of 114 Quranic manuscripts created by renowned rulers and calligraphers across the ages.\n\n‘Tremendous potential’\n\nWhile Nizami said the center has “tremendous potential,” he cautioned that “the building is a platform; what happens on the platform is entirely different,” stressing that its success depends on long-term research, education and cultural engagement.\n\nThere are criticisms of the center, relating to its cost, the sources of its funding, and the limited religious freedom in the country.\n\nCISC declined to comment on the building’s cost or funding sources.\n\nA construction fire in September delayed the center’s original launch, but the main construction work has been completed.\n\nWith around 60% of Uzbekistan’s population under the age of 35, Abdukhalikov said that the museum is for the next generation.\n\n“We have to inspire them and tell the story of our great history through innovation and creativity,” he added.", "title": "Inside Uzbekistan’s new multi-million-dollar cultural center", "sentiment": "positive", "reasoning": "The article discusses a new cultural center in Uzbekistan with a significant investment, showcasing the country's rich history and cultural identity, with no negative comments or criticisms mentioned.", "source": "https://egyptindependent.com/inside-uzbekistans-new-multi-million-dollar-cultural-center/", "published": "Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:36:58 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:58:08.200770"}

{"text": "Egypt’s Al-Sisi links national progress to strict law enforcement, says society has role in reforming legal application. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi on Wednesday linked national progress directly to the strict enforcement of laws without exception, arguing that the entire society, including families, schools, and media, has a critical role in developing awareness to ensure the proper application of the legal framework.\n\nThe Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces made the remarks during an interactive dialogue with students applying to the Egyptian Military Academy and its affiliated Military Colleges at the Academy’s headquarters in the New Administrative Capital. Upon his arrival, he was received by Lieutenant General Ashraf Zaher, Director of the Egyptian Military Academy, and the directors of the military colleges.\n\nLaw Enforcement and National Governance\n\nThe President stated that while Egypt has many laws, the crucial element is the proper application of existing legislation, stressing that the issue has a societal dimension and requires the development of thought and awareness among citizens.\n\nResponding to a query about his position regarding certain observations during the Parliamentary elections voting process, Al-Sisi affirmed that his actions amounted to a “veto” in objection to certain practices he was not satisfied with. He stressed his desire for all matters to be completed optimally, noting that he is striving to change the situation for the better since 2014 but that this requires conviction and will from everyone. He affirmed that he would prevent any obstacles to achieving this goal.\n\nHe stressed the importance of local councils, governorates, and all officials maintaining their assigned roles to maintain order and immediately deal with street-level problems.\n\nMilitary Academy and Education Standards\n\nPresidential Spokesperson Mohamed El-Shenawy stated that the President began the physique examinations by reiterating the Academy’s commitment to selecting the best candidates with objectivity and impartiality, using the latest accurate scientific standards applied transparently through an automated system for the October 2025 intake.\n\nAl-Sisi said the Academy plays a significant role in shaping the Egyptian character and preparing youth for the country’s rapid development.\n\nThe President stated that the Military College of Medicine offers an academic level comparable to the world’s best medical schools, affirming that its graduates will compete with those from the world’s top universities. He confirmed that qualified female and male students can join the college either with a military or civilian designation, and stressed that the internship phase is an integral part of the study.\n\nEconomy and Digital Strategy\n\nIn his dialogue, Al-Sisi addressed the economic situation, the size of cash reserves, managing domestic and foreign debt, creating jobs for youth, and implementing artificial intelligence, mechanisation, and digitalisation within state institutions.\n\nHe explained that the state has an ambitious plan for digitalisation and incorporating these fields into education to align with the labour markets.\n\nRegarding self-sufficiency, the President pointed out that by 2026, 4.5 million feddans will be added to Egypt’s current cultivated area of approximately 9 million feddans. He clarified that achieving self-sufficiency in all basic goods is practically impossible, given that 95% of Egypt is desert land, stressing the importance of rationalising consumption.\n\nAl-Sisi reviewed the benefits of operating the El Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant, including the production of 4.8 gigawatts of electricity and potential support for nuclear medicine. He also stressed improving public health and physical fitness among youth.\n\nReligious Scholars and Regional Issues\n\nDuring a meeting with Doctorate holders from the Ministry of Endowments (Awqaf) set to join a two-year academic course at the Military Academy, attended by Dr. Osama El-Azhary, Minister of Endowments, Al-Sisi stated that the intense study hours (10-12 hours daily) exceed those required for a doctorate, aiming for genuine enlightenment, preparing scholars, and combatting backwardness and extremism. He called on the imams to be guardians of freedom, including the freedom of belief.\n\nOn regional issues, Al-Sisi affirmed that Egypt seeks to achieve stability in all troubled countries in the region, citing its efforts to stop the war in the Gaza Strip. He added that Egypt has lost approximately $8 bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea in past years.\n\nThe President concluded by attributing the solidarity of Egyptians to divine grace and favour.", "title": "Egypt’s Al-Sisi links national progress to strict law enforcement, says society has role in reforming legal application", "sentiment": "positive", "reasoning": "The article highlights President Al-Sisi's emphasis on strict law enforcement and societal role in reform, indicating a sense of stability and progress, with a focus on national governance and education standards.", "source": "https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/26/egypts-al-sisi-links-national-progress-to-strict-law-enforcement-says-society-has-role-in-reforming-legal-application/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=egypts-al-sisi-links-national-progress-to-strict-law-enforcement-says-society-has-role-in-reforming-legal-application", "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 19:46:50 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:57:47.413563"}

{"text": "Egypt reports strong GDP growth in Q1 2025-26, led by non-oil industry, tourism, and ICT, minister says. CAIRO, Nov 27 (MENA) – Egypt’s non-oil industrial sector led economic growth in the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, contributing 1.83 percentage points to overall GDP, the Ministry of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation said on Thursday. The sector grew 14.5 percent, while communications and information technology also expanded 14.5 percent and tourism rose 13.8 percent.\n\nMinister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation Rania al-Mashat highlighted the growth during a weekly press briefing with Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, citing improvements in domestic and external demand, expanded production capacity and a more supportive industrial business environment, including targeted incentive policies. Key manufacturing industries, including vehicles, ready-made garments, chemicals, beverages, furniture and pharmaceuticals, posted double-digit growth ranging from 17 percent to 50 percent.\n\nMashat said the non-oil industrial sector’s growth is expected to continue, driven in part by plans to manufacture over 10 million mobile phones in 2025, compared to 3.3 million last year. Export-oriented industries also contributed to growth, with semi-finished goods exports up 8.4 percent in July and 34.1 percent in August and finished goods exports rising 2.8 percent and 2.4 percent over the same months. Specific sectors, including pharmaceuticals, sanitary paper, and ready-made garments, recorded significant export increases, reflecting the ability to convert production expansion into tangible export growth.\n\nAccording to Mashat, the communications and IT sector’s growth was fueled by Egypt’s national strategy to transform the sector into a technology-driven, export-oriented industry, with digital infrastructure investments and faster internet speeds expanding service coverage. She highlighted that Egypt received a regional leadership award from the Arab Organization for Communications and IT for progress in implementing IPv6.\n\nTourism, encompassing hotels and restaurants, grew 13.8 percent in Q1 2025-26, supported by improved services, transportation, marketing campaigns and adoption of AI technologies for tourist promotion, the minister said. Egypt maintained its top position as Africa’s leading tourist destination and rose six places globally in tourism performance rankings, she also said. Tourist nights increased to 58.7 million, and visitor numbers rose to 5.1 million, marking growth of 13.8 percent and 19.2 percent respectively compared to the same period last year, she added.\n\nAccording to her, “other sectors also contributed to GDP growth. Suez Canal activity rebounded for the first time since 2023-24, increasing 8.6 percent as regional stability returned. The electricity sector grew 5.4 percent, reflecting higher consumption across commercial, residential, industrial and other sectors, supported by infrastructure expansion and renewable energy integration. Transport and logistics expanded 3.9 percent, construction rose 3.3 percent, and banking grew 10.2 percent, supported by sound macroeconomic policies. The insurance sector posted 8.9 percent growth, driven by financial inclusion, digital platforms, and expanded coverage. Oil and gas activity saw a relative slowdown but recent discoveries in the Mediterranean and Gulf of Suez are expected to increase output.”\n\n“Private investment surged 25.9 percent in Q1 2025-26, representing around 66 percent of total investment, while credit to private businesses continued to recover. Structural reforms implemented between July 2024 and October 2025 included more than 350 measures across sectors such as startups, social programs, institutional efficiency, finance, regulation, strategy, digital transformation, incentives, transparency, industry and energy.”\n\nMashat concluded that preliminary economic indicators point to a projected GDP growth rate of at least 5 percent for fiscal year 2025-26, with potential for higher growth supported by macroeconomic stability, ongoing structural reforms, strong production activity and regional stability.", "title": "Egypt reports strong GDP growth in Q1 2025-26, led by non-oil industry, tourism, and ICT, minister says", "sentiment": "positive", "reasoning": "The article reports strong GDP growth, led by non-oil industry, tourism, and ICT, with key sectors posting double-digit growth, indicating a favorable economic outlook for Egypt.", "source": "https://egyptindependent.com/egypt-reports-strong-gdp-growth-in-q1-2025-26-led-by-non-oil-industry-tourism-and-ict-minister-says/", "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 10:38:17 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-29T11:15:06.136519"}
{"text": "US will reexamine all green cards issued to people from 19 countries as Trump administration ramps up immigration crackdown. The US will reexamine all green cards issued to people from 19 countries “of concern” at President Donald Trump’s direction, as the Trump administration intensifies its immigration crackdown following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC.\n\n“At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” Joe Edlow, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, wrote in a post on X Thursday.\n\nAsked for additional details, including which countries are considered to be “of concern,” USCIS pointed CNN to 19 countries listed in a June presidential proclamation.\n\nThe 19 countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n\nUSCIS said in a statement later Thursday that when vetting immigrants from those 19 countries, the agency will now take into consideration “negative, country specific factors,” which includes whether the country is able “to issue secure identity documents.”\n\nSince officials last night identified the suspect of the shooting as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, the Trump administration has ramped up its efforts to restrict immigration.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said Thursday the administration is also reviewing all asylum cases that were approved under former President Joe Biden.\n\n“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN, adding, “The Trump Administration is also reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden Administration.”\n\nLakanwal — who previously worked with the US government, including the CIA — came to the country in 2021 as part of Biden’s “Operation Allies Welcome” after assisting the US in Afghanistan.

Milan/Cortina d’Ampezzo Reuters —\n\nLocal organizers have been forced to cap the number of tickets on sale for Winter Olympics events in Cortina d’Ampezzo in February because of concerns over transport congestion, heightened by delays in building a new cable car to take fans up the mountain.\n\nThe issues facing the Apollonio-Socrepes gondola are the most pressing sign of the transport challenges that Italy faces as it stages a Games co-hosted by Cortina, and the city of Milan, with events spread across other parts of northern Italy.\n\nWith the Games a little over two months away, work is well behind schedule on building the cable car link to carry thousands of spectators from the town center to the Tofane Alpine Skiing center where the women’s races are being held.\n\nCap on ticket numbers\n\nIn the town itself, Cortina will host curling, as well as bobsled, luge and skeleton in the new sliding center.\n\nMassimo Bortoluzzi, provincial transport councillor, said uncertainty over the cable car project and delays in preparing the collection points for spectators heading to the events have prompted a preliminary 15% cut in initial spectator estimates of 200,000.\n\n“We need to draw a line, we’ve come too close to the deadline and now risk problems finding drivers and shuttles,” Bortoluzzi told Reuters.\n\nOrganizers have temporarily restricted the number of tickets available for events in Cortina to match the transport system’s current capacity and to avoid excessive traffic, a spokesperson for the Milano Cortina 2026 Foundation, the local organizing committee said, without providing precise figures.\n\nTraffic to be limited during Games\n\nSet in the Dolomites, Cortina is one of Italy’s best known winter resorts and staged the Games in 1956, but it has no rail station and access by the only main road into town can often be slow at peak times. Cars remain the main way to get around a town that is home to only around 5,500 permanent residents.\n\nSpecial measures are being introduced to try to ease congestion during the Olympics which run from February 6 to February 22.\n\nOnly vehicles with permits will be allowed to access parts of the town – these are being made available to local households, second-home owners and people providing services during the Games.\n\nFans with tickets for Olympic events will have to leave their cars at designated areas and take shuttle buses to reach the events.\n\nCable car faces pressing deadline\n\nThe cable car should help to ease overcrowding by whisking visitors directly from an elementary school in the town to the slopes.\n\nThe project, known as a gondola ropeway, involves 10 pylons and three stations – valley, intermediate and summit – with 50 cabins seating 10 people each, able to carry 2,400 passengers an hour.\n\nBogged down by a lengthy approval process, the contract was awarded to a company only in July, but the project also faced a legal challenge from a group of local residents who sought to block it in court.\n\nIn an area prone to landslides, a crack in the ground further complicated work.\n\nSimico, the state-backed agency in charge of building the Games infrastructure, has repeatedly said it will deliver the gondola on time, pointing to what happened with the sliding center where worries over delays were overcome.\n\nIn an interview with state broadcaster RAI on November 22, Simico special commissioner Massimo Saldini said the bulk of the project will be ready by the end of December, with final testing to follow in January.\n\nFranco Sovilla, who owns a historic bookshop in Cortina, is looking ahead to the potential long-term benefits.\n\n“Right now, there’s only one road to reach the Tofane slopes, and without this link, traffic would be heavy.

The death toll from Israel’s offensive in the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, has risen to 69,785, with 170,965 wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry said ten people were brought to Gaza hospitals in the past 24 hours, including two newly killed and eight whose bodies were recovered from beneath the rubble of destroyed buildings.\n\nIt added that since the ceasefire announced on 11 October, a total of 347 people have been killed and 889 injured, while 596 bodies have been retrieved from the debris during the same period. The ministry said it had received 15 additional bodies via the International Committee of the Red Cross, bringing the total number of bodies handed over to 345, of which 99 have been identified. Medical teams continue the process of documenting and preparing the remains for handover to families.\n\nThe ministry warned of an unprecedented collapse of Gaza’s health system, reporting that 54 percent of essential medicines are unavailable, while 40 percent of emergency drugs have completely run out. It said 82 percent of infants under one year are suffering from anaemia, and 18,100 patients are awaiting permission to travel for treatment. Medical supplies are at their lowest levels ever recorded in Gaza, with 71% of items unavailable due to Israeli restrictions.\n\nOn the issue of captives and bodies, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said the group’s handover of the body of an Israeli soldier is part of its “commitment to fully completing the exchange process,” urging mediators to pressure Israel to halt the war and abide by the agreements reached.\n\nAs winter approaches, the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said thousands of displaced families in Gaza are struggling to find safe shelter in increasingly cold conditions.

He affirmed that the UN would “never retreat from its commitment to the Palestinian people.”\n\nUN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese said a new UN report concludes that Israel’s war on Gaza has erased “69 years of human development,” destroying healthcare systems, schools, infrastructure and even the banking sector, pushing Gaza back decades in development indicators.\n\nInternational agencies warn that continued military operations and declining access to basic services threaten to accelerate the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, while expanding Israeli operations in the West Bank fuel further instability across the occupied Palestinian territories.", "title": "Gaza death toll rises as humanitarian crisis deepens, Israeli offensive expands in West Bank", "sentiment": "negative", "reasoning": "The article reports a high death toll, humanitarian crisis, and collapse of Gaza's health system, indicating a strongly negative financial and social sentiment.", "source": "https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/26/gaza-death-toll-rises-as-humanitarian-crisis-deepens-israeli-offensive-expands-in-west-bank/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gaza-death-toll-rises-as-humanitarian-crisis-deepens-israeli-offensive-expands-in-west-bank", "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:03:55 +0000", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:57:37.477439"}

Egypt’s economy grew by 5.3% in the first quarter of the 2025/2026 fiscal year, GDP growth exceeded 5% for the first time in more than three years, the Ministry of Planning, Economic Development, and International Cooperation said.\n\nThe GDP growth rate, up from 3.5% in the same period a year earlier, marks the strongest quarterly performance in over two years. The ministry attributed the acceleration to structural reforms that are bolstering the real economy and steering the growth model toward tradable, high-productivity sectors including manufacturing, tourism, and telecommunications.\n\nPrivate investments grew by 25.9%, accounting for 66% of total executed investments—the highest level recorded compared with previous periods. Conversely, the share of public investment declined to 34%, reflecting a government strategy to rationalise spending and prioritise high-impact projects while empowering the private sector.\n\n“This acceleration reflects the tangible impact of ongoing economic and structural reforms,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nMinister of Planning, Economic Development, and International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat said the higher-than-expected growth reflects sustained momentum driven by non-oil manufacturing, tourism, and telecommunications.\n\n“Macroeconomic stability enables structural reforms, while reforms reinforce stability, laying the foundation for sustainable growth,” Al-Mashat said, noting that preliminary indicators point to a positive outlook for the full fiscal year with projections of at least 5% GDP growth.\n\nSector Performance\n\nNon-oil manufacturing activity expanded by 14.5% during the quarter, compared to 7.1% in the previous year.

The ministry cited improved infrastructure and marketing campaigns for the rise, noting that Egypt has topped the list of leading African tourist destinations for the third consecutive year.\n\nSuez Canal activity recorded positive growth of 8.6%, the first increase since the second quarter of the 2023/2024 fiscal year.

Petroleum activity declined by 6.6% and natural gas by 10.9%. However, the ministry noted the pace of contraction has slowed compared to the 8.9% decline in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, supported by recent discoveries.\n\nSince August, 75 new oil and gas discoveries were made and 383 new wells added to the production map, addingapproximately 1.1bn cubic feet of gas and 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day to production capacity.\n\nLooking ahead, the ministry stated that a more stable regional environment is expected to further enhance confidence.

In his first overseas speech, he lamented that the globe was seeing an unusual number of bloody conflicts.\n\nAt an event with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, the pope warned that a third world war was being \"fought piecemeal\", with humanity's future at risk.\n\nPOPE MEETING CHRISTIAN LEADERS FROM EGYPT, ISRAEL\n\nTravelling abroad has become a major feature of the modern papacy, with popes drawing international attention as they lead events with crowds sometimes in the millions, give foreign policy speeches and carry out international diplomacy.\n\nLeo will travel on Friday to Iznik, 140 km (90 miles) southeast of Istanbul and once called Nicaea, where early churchmen formulated the Nicene Creed, which lays out what remain the core beliefs of most Christians today.\n\nHe will be joined by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of the world's 260 million Orthodox Christians, as well as other Christian leaders from countries such as Turkey, Egypt and Israel.\n\nOrthodox and Catholic Christians split in the East-West Schism of 1054, but have generally sought in recent decades to build closer ties.\n\nWhile Turkey now has about 33,000 Catholics among a population of about 85 million, Vatican statistics show, it was once a flourishing land for Christianity, home to important early saints such as the apostles Philip, Paul and John.\n\nCROWDED ITINERARY IN TURKEY, LEBANON\n\nLeo, 70 and in good health,has a crowded itinerary during his six-day overseas trip.\n\nIn Turkey, he will also visit Istanbul's Blue Mosque on Saturday, in his first visit as pope to a Muslim place of worship, and will celebrate a Catholic Mass at the city's Volkswagen Arena.\n\nPeace is expected to be a key theme of the pope's visit to Lebanon, which starts on Sunday.\n\nLebanon, which has the largest share of Christians in the Middle East, has been rocked by the spillover of theGaza conflict,as Israel and the Lebanese Shi'ite Muslim militant group Hezbollah went to war, culminating in a devastating Israeli offensive.\n\nLeaders in Lebanon, which hosts 1 million Syrian and Palestinian refugees and is also struggling to recover after years of economic crisis, are worried Israel will dramatically escalate its strikes in coming months and hope the papal visit might bring global attention to the country.\n\n(Reporting by Joshua McElwee; Editing by Daren Butler and Clarence Fernandez)", "title": "Pope Leo to meet Middle East Christian leaders in bid for unity", "sentiment": "neutral", "reasoning": "The article discusses a religious event and does not contain any financial information or sentiment.", "source": "https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/pope-leo-meet-middle-east-christian-leaders-bid-unity", "published": "2025-11-28T01:36:36-0500", "timestamp": "2025-11-28T16:59:41.432159"}

He lived in Bellingham, acoastal city near Canada's border, with his wife and five children.\n\nPirro said he ambushed the two National Guardsmen on Wednesday as they patrolled near the White House. Armed with a powerful handgun, a .357 Magnum, he shot one Guardsman who fell, and then shot them again, before firing multiple times at the second Guardsman, Pirro added.\n\nLakanwal was wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other Guardsmen before he was arrested and taken to hospital, where he remains under heavy guard. The authorities have not given an update on his condition or a motive for the attack.\n\nPirro said Lakanwal faces three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and a charge of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.\n\nHe will also be charged with murder in the first degree if the Guardsmen, who are currently in critical condition, do not survive their injuries, she said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox Newsthe U.S. government plans to bring terrorism charges against Lakanwal and seek a sentence of life in prison \"at a minimum.\"\n\nLakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era immigration program to resettle thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during the war and feared reprisal from Taliban forces who seized control after the U.S. withdrawal.

The Israeli military said in a statement that the two members of the militant group were planning future attacks on Israel.\n\nThe incident turned deadly after clashes broke out, the Israeli military said in a statement.

The sector maintained its pivotal role in financial intermediation, supplying credit to diverse segments of the economy and offering an expanding array of financial products.

It affects everything — from taxes and liability to credibility, funding options, and long-term growth.\n\nFor many new entrepreneurs, the decision often comes down to two options: a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or a Sole Establishment. Both have their advantages and limitations, depending on your business activity, capital, and vision for expansion.\n\nIf you’re exploring business setup in Dubai, understanding the key differences between these two structures will help you choose the one that best fits your goals.

This means that shareholders’ personal assets are protected from business debts and liabilities.

This makes it a popular choice for startups planning to attract partners or scale operations in the future.\n\nSole Establishment\n\nA Sole Establishment, also called a Sole Proprietorship, is owned and managed by a single individual who assumes full personal liability for the business.
